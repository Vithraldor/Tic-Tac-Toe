# Tic-Tac-Toe
[In development] Extension of a game created during ECE244, an introductory C++ course.

If you are a current ECE244 student, do not copy the code in this repository! Not only is it an academic offense, but it's also a surefire way to do poorly in the course.
You learn more by coding the game yourself, not by copying other peoples' code.
